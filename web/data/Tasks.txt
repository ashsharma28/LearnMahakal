STUDYING:
1.
10 hours continuous study for a  day is far better then 30 mins daily for 20 days... i.e. Study daily the concept, for long time and effective learning instead of sitting alltogether after 5 days and covering all leftout :(

2.
No ALl-nighters at all strictly U bitch
Daily scheduled learning is the most most Important as brain suits yoursel to study a thing at that time automatically, i.e. Just follow your schedule strictly or else u r gone for long u fool. and fuck thats easy too bc..

3.
DO NOT USE HIGHLIGHTING AND RE RADING( AS FOR LEARNING) AT ANT COST, change your approach, thats not the way brain s ment to taught somethings, and its even connfidence killer and Opposite reactor for productivity and learning
	Instead use something like FLASHCARDS bc...Use your mobile//...like...keep it to ur table for ur lunch times and when u return from college,,,,thats revision...which also do help for pt. 4


4.
Have goals for each sessions, dont mug up but at the end just ask yourself , that HAVE U ACHIEVED THE GOAL...dont go for all the things in one session, instead go for a specific outcome/ output that help for your good grades
(eg. I solved the question of last yrs. QP in a hardcore manner...Now aajaaye ye que, dekh loonga)
And ask yourself at the End so that you can explain it to anyone, your room mates etc..Have that as a goal WHICH IS PT. 5


5.
LEARN IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU COULD EASILY TEACH IT TO SOMEONE EFFICIENTLY, this approach is far more better than any others. DON'T FEEL DOWN IN TEACHING TO OTHERS, they wont matter at all at any cost, if you are doing your work sincerely, they are not competitions. 

6.
PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE, this will boost your confidence..

7.
YOUR STUDY TABLE IS A GOOD PLACE TO STUDY , coz that have evrything that could be needed

8.
NO MUSIC WHILE STUDYING,

9.
 PUT YOUR CELLPHONE ON A STRICT PRIORITY MODE WHILE STUDYING, NO TEXTS OR WHATSAPP OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF NOTIFICATION WHILE YOU STUDY,
